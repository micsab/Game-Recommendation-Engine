# Steam Recommendation Engine #
## Overview ##
As someone somewhere probably said, it's the best time to be playing video games.  Democratization of the tools needed and technical know-how has gotten to the point that almost anyone can sit down and within a matter of 80-100 work weeks over 2-4 years (lol) crank out a game.  But with this over-abundance of choice comes a new problem... UNCERTAINTY. "Do I buy that hot new game that just came out?  What about that other new hot game that came out or that older game that everyone said was great?  Hell, maybe I should just play one of the games I already bought but never installed?”  My aim is to build a recommendation engine that will help people (ME) with this.  Specifically, the engine will not just recommend games available on steam, but will also recommend you games that are already in your library but unplayed.  Yay for saving money!

## Data Collection ##
In order to build the recommendation engine using steam, I used BeautifulSoup to crawl the Steam Store for all games with steam pages. I did this in two steps.  Step 1 was generating a list of links to each game's steam page, starting at page 1 (https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&page=1).  Once I was able to grab every link, I iterated through each one, grabbing relevant fields such as title, image, description, tags, reviews, etc.

### Grabbing each store link ###


```python
# Get title and links for all steam games
urls = ['https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&page={}'.format(i) for i in range(1, 1185)]

filename = "products_v2.csv"
f = open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8")
headers = "game_title\tsteam_url\n"
f.write(headers)

for url in urls:
    r = requests.get(url)
    page_soup = soup(r.content, "html.parser")

    containers = page_soup.findAll("a", {"class":"search_result_row ds_collapse_flag "})

    for container in containers:
        game_title = container.findAll("span", {"class":"title"})[0].text
        link = container["href"]

        #print(game_title)
        #print(link)
        #print("----------------")

        f.write(game_title + "\t" + link + "\n")

f.close()
```

### Iterating through each link, grabing all relevant info from the page###


```python
df_links = pd.read_csv('products_v2.csv', delimiter="\t")

tags = []
images = []
descriptions = []
num_reviews = []
rating_values = []
releases = []

cookies = {'birthtime': '568022401'}

for link in df_links.iterrows():
    print(link[1]['game_title'])
    url = link[1]['steam_url']
    r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
    page_soup = soup(r.content, 'lxml')
    try:
        tag = page_soup.find("div", {"class":"glance_tags popular_tags"})
        tag = tag.text
        tag = tag.replace('\t', '').replace('\r', '').replace('\n', ', ').replace('+, ', '').replace(', , ', '')
        tags.append(tag)
    except:
        tag = 'no tags'
        tags.append(tag)
    
    try:
        image = page_soup.find('img', {'class':'game_header_image_full'})['src']
        images.append(image)
    except:
        image = 'no_image'
        images.append(image)
    
    try:
        num_review = int(page_soup.find('meta', {'itemprop':'reviewCount'})['content'])
        num_reviews.append(num_review)
    except:
        num_review = 'no reviews'
        num_reviews.append(num_review)

    try:
        rating_value = float(page_soup.find('meta', {'itemprop':'ratingValue'})['content'])
        rating_values.append(rating_value)
    except:
        rating_value = 'no rating'
        rating_values.append(rating_value)
    
    try:
        description = page_soup.find('div', {'class': 'game_description_snippet'}).text.replace('\t','').replace('\r','').replace('\n', '')
        descriptions.append(description)
    except:
        description = 'no description'
        descriptions.append(description)
        
    try:
        release = page_soup.find('div', {'class': 'date'}).text
        releases.append(release)
    except:
        release = 'no release date'
        releases.append(release)

        
        
    
      
the_rest = pd.DataFrame({'tags': tags, 'image': images, 'description': descriptions,
                         'number_of_review': num_reviews,
                         'score': rating_values,
                         'release_date': releases})

steam_scrape_the_rest = pd.concat([df_links, the_rest], axis=1, sort=False)
steam_scrape_the_rest.to_csv('steam_games_all_fields.csv', sep='\t')
```

## Data Cleaning and Processing ##


```python
steam_games = pd.read_csv('steam_games_all_fields.csv', index_col=0, delimiter='\t')

# Split out 'appid' from the URL string.  This will be used later to merge in my own games
# from the steam api
app_id = steam_games['steam_url'].str.split('/',expand=True)
app_id = app_id.drop([0, 1, 2, 5, 6], axis=1)
app_id.columns = ['app', 'game_ID']
df = pd.concat([steam_games, app_id], axis=1, sort=False)

# Fill nil values and remove random characters
df['description'] = df['description'].fillna('')
df = df[~df.description.str.contains('no description')]
df['release_date'] = df['release_date'].replace({'no release date' : ''})
df['game_title'] = df['game_title'].str.replace(r'®', '')
df['game_title'] = df['game_title'].str.replace(r'™', '')
df['number_of_review'] = df['number_of_review'].replace({'no reviews' : ''})
df['score'] = df['score'].replace({'no rating' : ''})

# Dropping unneeded/dupe columns and renaming others for merge purposes later
df = df.drop(['app'], axis=1)
df['game_ID'] = pd.to_numeric(df['game_ID'], downcast='signed')
df['number_of_review'] = pd.to_numeric(df['number_of_review'], downcast='integer')
df['score'] = pd.to_numeric(df['score'])

# Game must have a score, scores are not calculated until a min number of reviews is satisfied
df = df[df['score'] > 0]
df = df.rename(columns={"game_ID": "appid"})
df = df.rename(columns={"Unnamed: 0": "id"})
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='appid', keep='first')
df = df.dropna(subset=['game_title'])
df = df.reset_index()
df = df.drop(['index'], axis=1)
print('Dataframe Shape', df.shape)
df.head()

### Using the Steam API to Build My Games DF###
In order to create a recommendation engine that recommends my own games, I needed to find a way to procure my own steam games data.  While I could have also grabbed this data via web scraping, I decided to make use of Steam's API, which allows for easy access into a person's steam games library, provided a user_ID is provided.


```python
my_steam_id = 76561197974553664
games = interface('IPlayerService').GetOwnedGames(steamid=my_steam_id, include_appinfo=1)
my_games = games['response']['games']
game_table = pd.DataFrame(my_games)
game_table = game_table.drop(['has_community_visible_stats', 'playtime_2weeks',
                              'img_icon_url', 'img_logo_url'], axis=1)
# Convert playtime from minutes to hours
game_table['playtime_forever'] = game_table['playtime_forever'] / 60
my_games_info = pd.merge(df, game_table, on='appid')
print('My Games DataFrame Shape:', my_games_info.shape)

my_games_describe = my_games_info[['number_of_review', 'score', 'playtime_forever']]
my_games_describe.describe()
```

## Building the Recommender ##

Evaluating a recommender is tough.  Since people's choices and preferences are subjective, there aren't a lot of metrics that can tell you whether or not your enginge performed well beyond looking at it and thinking that it did a goog job.  To try and combat this a bit, I built 3 different versions of the engine, one run by steam tags, another by descriptions, and a hybrid of the two. Then within each of those groups I split out the engine to have 1 that selects games you already own and recommends them to you, and another that looks at all the games you don't own.
<br>

For building the actual recommender system, I had originally decided that I would use Steam tags that are associated with every game.  However, because it was easy enough to collect, I also had descriptions for every game.  So I decided to test the recommendation system with three different setups.  The first being description only, the second being tags only, and the third being a hybrid of both.

### How the Recommender Works ###
While I will have built a number of different version, all of the recommenders work in roughly the same way.  Text (either game descriptions or steam tags) is taken in and converted into a matrix of token counts via sklearn's CountVectorizer module.  

### Parsing Game Descriptions ###
For building the recommender with text descriptions, I had initially wanted to use sklearn's term frequency inverse document frequency module to break the descriptions down to components and assign specific weights to words, but over the course of testing I found that the countvectorizer module produced much better results across all of the models I built. TFIDF was matching up games with very short descriptions that had I uncommon word in them but nothing else.  Countvectorizer got rid of this problem.


```python
lemmatizer = nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer()

def lemmatize_text(text):
    return [lemmatizer.lemmatize(w) for w in text]
```


```python
cv_desc = df[['appid', 'game_title', 'tags', 'description']]

stop_words = set(STOPWORDS)
lemmatizer = nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer()
stemmer = SnowballStemmer('english')
tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z\']+')

cv_desc['stemmed'] = cv_desc.description.apply(lambda x: stemmer.stem(x))
cv_desc['tokens'] = cv_desc.stemmed.apply(lambda x: tokenizer.tokenize(x))
cv_desc['lemmed'] = cv_desc.tokens.apply(lemmatize_text)
cv_desc['stopped'] = cv_desc.lemmed.apply(lambda x: [item for item in x if item not in stop_words])
cv_desc['desc']=cv_desc['stopped'].apply(lambda x: ', '.join(map(str, x)))
```


```python
cv_desc['desc'][3]
```




    'insurgency, sandstorm, team, based, tactical, fps, based, lethal, close, quarter, combat, objective, oriented, multiplayer, gameplay, experience, intensity, modern, combat, skill, rewarded, teamwork, win, fight'



After stemming, tokening, lemming, and stopping the description data, I ran it through the Countvectorizer.  I set ngram_range equal to (1, 2) since often games have titles that are multiple words long and I wanted those values to be extracted together.  Once I got the matrix of counts I applyed the cosine_similarity function in order to compute the similarity of each game.


```python
cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', lowercase=True, ngram_range=(1,2))
cv_matrix = cv.fit_transform(cv_desc['desc'])

# Linear kernel provides better results for descriptions
cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity(cv_matrix, cv_matrix)

results_desc = {}

for idx, row in cv_desc.iterrows():
    similar_indices = cosine_similarities[idx].argsort()[:-500:-1]
    similar_items = [(cosine_similarities[idx][i], cv_desc['appid'][i]) for i in similar_indices]
    results_desc[row['appid']] = similar_items[1:]
    
print('Done!')
```

    Done!



```python
def recommend(game, num):
    app_id = cv_desc.loc[cv_desc['game_title'] == game]['appid'].tolist()[0]
    
    print('Recommending ' + str(num) + " games sitting in your Steam library unplayed, that are similar to " + 
          game + '.')

    rez = results_desc[app_id]

    sim_score_df = pd.DataFrame(rez, columns=['sim_score', 'appid'])
    my_game_df = pd.merge(sim_score_df, my_games_info, how='inner', on='appid')
    my_game_df = my_game_df.drop(['appid', 'number_of_review', 'release_date', 'name', 'score',
                                  'tags', 'description', 'steam_url', 'image'], axis = 1)
   
    # Filter out games I've played more than an hour of
    my_game_df = my_game_df[my_game_df['playtime_forever'] <= 1]
    my_game_df = my_game_df.sort_values(['sim_score'], ascending=False)
    return my_game_df.head(num)

recommend("Assassin's Creed Odyssey", 5)

#### Hybrid Descriptions & Steam Tags ####

```python

lemmatizer = nltk.stem.WordNetLemmatizer()
stemmer = SnowballStemmer('english')
tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z\']+')

cv_hybrid['stemmed'] = cv_hybrid.description.apply(lambda x: stemmer.stem(x))
cv_hybrid['tokens'] = cv_hybrid.stemmed.apply(lambda x: tokenizer.tokenize(x))
cv_hybrid['lemmed'] = cv_hybrid.tokens.apply(lemmatize_text)
cv_hybrid['stopped'] = cv_hybrid.lemmed.apply(lambda x: [item for item in x if item not in stop_words])
cv_hybrid['desc']=cv_hybrid['stopped'].apply(lambda x: ', '.join(map(str, x)))

```


```python
cv_hybrid['tag_desc'] = cv_hybrid[['tags', 'desc']].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x), axis=1)
cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer='word', lowercase=True, ngram_range=(1,2))
cv_hybrid_matrix = cv.fit_transform(cv_hybrid['tag_desc'])
cosine_similarities = cosine_similarity(cv_hybrid_matrix, cv_hybrid_matrix)

results_tags_desc = {}

for idx, row in cv_hybrid.iterrows():
    similar_indices = cosine_similarities[idx].argsort()[:-500:-1]
    similar_items = [(cosine_similarities[idx][i], cv_hybrid['appid'][i]) for i in similar_indices]

    # First item is the item itself, so remove it.
    # Each dictionary entry is like: [(1,2), (3,4)], with each tuple being (score, item_id)

### I Declare Hybrid The Winner ###
While all three of the models performed well and gave me results that I would consider well within the normal range of what I might consider to be a good recommendation, I think the hybrid system does slightly better than the tag-only system, so it gets the edge.  The fact that it was able to see that I fed it an Assassin's Creed game and recommend me literally EVERY single one that I don't own (on steam) is commendable.  It also performed well when I fed it a party/competative game (Rocket League) and a large scale shooter (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds). 

<br>
The tag-only system also did well and, one could, say that it is actually a better performer cause it give some variety, but I don't want variety I want games that I'm going to like!  Description-only comes in last, not surprising considering that most game descriptions on the steam store can be fairly generic and short.

### Evaluation ###
While evalulation a content-based filtering system is tough due to the subjective nature of recommendations, we can do a little bit to prove that the recommender is basic than something more basic.
<br>

Below I wrote out two different simple models that output a list of games at random, for both the games in my steam list and also any and all games in the steam store.  In the second group, I sorted the order by a metric I made up called "popularity", which is simply the score a game has multiplied by it's number of reviews.  Let's see how they did.


```python
rando_games = df.iloc[np.random.choice(np.arange(len(df)), 10, False)]
print('Random List of Steam Games', '\n')
print(rando_games[['game_title', 'score']].head())
print('------------------------------------------------------------------------------')
my_games_rando = my_games_info[my_games_info['playtime_forever'] <= 1]
my_games_rando = my_games_rando.iloc[np.random.choice(np.arange(len(my_games_rando)), 10, False)]
print('Random List of My Games:')
print(my_games_rando[['game_title', 'score']].head())
```

As expected, the completely random one doesn't fair too well.  Since there are > 14k steam games, there's is a lot of variabiilty in the types of games you're going to get each time you run it.  Also, since it's strictly random, it does not take into account any preference you might have.  The ordered by popularity random list fairs slightly better in that, at least you're getting fed games of a, generally, high quality.  However, as before, this model does not care about your preferences, if you are looking to play a shooting game, this model is just as likely to recommend you a narrative text adventure as it would a shooter (or anything else).

## Running in Production + Conclusions ##
To run this fully in production I would make a couple changes.  For starters I would not include the scraping utility in the callable program since it takes longer to run than any reasonable person would want to wait.  Ideally that would be something that gets run once a week, with an updated version of the dataset replacing the old, so that whenver the program is run it's fetching the newest data.  I would also not have 3 different versions of this program, only the hybrid would remain since it produced the best results.  For a user to run the program, a web-based UI would probably work best. It would need two inputs in order to run, the steam_id of the person, as well as a game they want to use to seed the recommender.  A v2 implementation would have an option to auto-seed based on the user's most played game, but we're still on v1 right now...
<br>

Overall I would say that I'm fairly pleased with the results I was able to get.  My original vision for this project was to be able to create a program that would recommend me a game that I already owned but hadn't played, which I have succeeded in doing.  Areas of improvement though would be around dataset size as well as automatically inputting whatever your most played game is (or group of games).  While Steam is the largest gaming platform on PC, there are many other platforms with big games that were left out of this dataset. Either scraping those sites and incorporating them into the overall dataset, or finding and utilizing a 3rd party database API would result in a bigger set of data and better recommendations.
